# Basilisk & Gerris post-processing files
Inspired and modified from Vastal's repo: https://github.com/VatsalSy/postProcessPython
* fieldExtraction_triangulate.py: extract scalar fields from Gerris .gfs files. This file is improved with triangulated contours, which is better for cases with solids or masked cells (comparison using shock reflection example).
