# Basilisk & Gerris post-processing files
Inspired and modified from Vastal's repo: https://github.com/VatsalSy/postProcessPython

Referred from previous codes: https://github.com/MGYBY/Basilisk_practice/tree/main/2d_sims

* fieldExtraction_triangulate.py: extract scalar fields from Gerris .gfs files. This file is improved with triangulated contours, which is better for cases with solids or masked cells (comparison using shock reflection example).
