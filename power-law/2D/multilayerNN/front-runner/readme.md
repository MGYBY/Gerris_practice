The front-runner simulation.

**Features:**
- [x] Generalized Saint-Venant solver.
- [x] Herschel-Bulkley & the related steady-uniform state.
- [ ] Forward difference & central difference (seems better). Difference considering BCs.
- [x] Mesh adaptation.
- [x] Text field output, gnuplot images output, movie generation.
- [ ] Plots for dimensionless variables, better fonts.
- [ ] Surface tension (not important).
- [ ] Horizontal viscosity (not important).
- [x] Other post-processing tools: Gnuplot, OriginLab, ...
